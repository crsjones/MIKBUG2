# MIKBUG version 2.0

A PDF file containing the listing of MIKBUG 2.0 can be found in a few places on the internet.
There does not appear to be a source file available.

In a moment of stupidity or bravery I suggested to the MOTOROLA 6809 / 6309, 6800 ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE PROGRAMMING group 
on Facebook that we could share the work in converting this PDF into a source file so we could run it again.

### mikbug20.pdf is the original file.
### Mikbug20srconly.pdf is the original file with only the listing of the code.
### MIKBUG2.asm is the source file we are trying to create.

Will this work? I don't know but if you want to help, type in a page and use git to submit it here
or send the text page to me and I will collate it.
